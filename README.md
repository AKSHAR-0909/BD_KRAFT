# BD_KRAFT

Run

`docker-compose up -d`

There is an extra container called the observer which can be used to visualize the simple timeout function(for testing) in the controller nodes.

Replace the timeout function with the proper one and add rest of the code. For communication between nodes use *http using the requests module* like it has been done.
